# CV

A simple, modern CV / resume template.

## Creating Your CV

(You need `npm` in order to build the project. If it's not installed, install npm from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm))

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Fill in the `.json` files in `src/html/contents` with your information. 

Then, run `grunt build` and get your fresh CV in the HTML format: `index.html`


## Contributing

1. Fork the repo (By clicking the `"Fork"` button on the upper-right side of the page)
2. Clone the repo (`git clone https://github.com/-YOUR NAME-/cv.git`)
3. Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Run `grunt` and keep it open while making your changes. Please keep the default JSON files while contributing, since I serve my CV to some places directly from this repo.
6. When you're finished; run `grunt build`, commit (`git commit -am "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE"`) and push (`git push`) your changes.
7. Make a pull request, from [here](https://github.com/smddzcy/cv/compare).

You can pick one of the TODO's below and start contributing right away. Thank you so much!
